[`warble`](https://github.comm/slurmulon/warble) is a dynamic notation for representing musical tracks with a focus on human readibility and productivity.

`juke` consumes and renders `warble` tracks against audio files (mp3, wav, etc.).

In other words, `juke` syncronizes the time between the musical notation defined in a `warble` track and its accompanying audio.
